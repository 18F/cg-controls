# README

The authoritative deliver conmon guidance is at: https://github.com/cloud-gov/product/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/conmon-1-deliver.md

So there should be no README beyond that.

The original version of these files lived in a Google Drive repo file at:
`/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/cloud.gov/Security and Compliance/Compliance/conmon-git-project`
but that proved unwieldy.
