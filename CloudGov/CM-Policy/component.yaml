    a: '18F uses established and documents configuration settings for its information
      technology products employed within the Cloud Foundry platform that reflect
      the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements. 18F follows
      industry best practices and guidance provided in NIST Special Publication 800-70,
      Security Configuration Checklist Program for IT Products

      Infrastructure documented configuration settings:

      DevOps and Security Engineers maintain the baseline configuration for VPC, EBS
      and AMIs.  Best practices, FISMA compliant AMIs, and hardened cloud formation
      templates are utilized as there are no benchmarks available. 18F uses the following
      approved FISMA ready baselines located at https://github.com/fisma-ready

      Cloud Foundry documented configuration settings:

      18F follows Cloud Foundry best practices for configuring and implementing the
      platform as a service. Configuration settings are documented within the deployment
      manifest on the GitHub and Cloud Foundry websites. The following are approved
      baseline configuration settings related to the Cloud Foundry platform as a service.
      All documented configuration settings  related to Cloud Foundry are located  at
      https://docs.18f.gov/ops/repos/.

      '
    b: '18F Implements the configuration settings based on its documented process
      and practices. DevOps implements the configuration benchmarks identified in
      Part a, maintains the baseline configuration for all cloud infrastructure and
      Cloud Foundry components and is responsible for ensuring all systems are configured
      in accordance with applicable hardening guides.

      '
    c: 'DevOps documents any exceptions to established baseline configurations for
      all of 18F''s virtual infrastructure and information systems. 18F maintains
      exception documents which detail specific items from the established configuration
      settings which cannot be applied to instances due to operational requirements.

      '
    d: '18F Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance
      with its documented configuration management policy and procedures.

      All Configuration Change Control:

      DevOps and 18F system owners maintain the baseline configurations within 18F
      Virtual Private Cloud. Configuration will be reviewed in real-time using automated
      methods and at least quarterly to ensure no unauthorized changes were made to
      the baseline configuration.

      Internal vulnerability scans are performed at least on a quarterly basis in
      the event that no enhancements or upgrades are performed.

  narrative: '18F posts its current inventory of information systems on its dashboard
    located at  https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/. Several sources are used to capture
    complete inventories of the virtual infrastructure and its information systems
    while providing the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting.
    The AWS Management Console, VisualOps, Cloud Checkr, Github, and Nexpose are used
    to provide additional enumeration capabilities.

    Cloud Checkr is currently deployed to facilitate asset management, along with
    other operations activities, on a real-time ongoing basis. Components deployed
    in the virtual infrastructure are accurately inventoried and can be filtered to
    a specific informaton system groups as well as a group of web services or  those
    components that are related to a spcecific informaton system.

    The VisualOps Cloud management tool is used to provide a visual, real-time and
    automated representation of the virtual infrastructure and applications within
    the 18F environment. It also provides a global view of the 18F AWS account where
    all regions and services can be seen in one place.

    The 18F GitHub respository also is used to show a current lists of components
    that make up the Cloud.Gov inventory. It is located at https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/repos/

    Nexpose maintains an inventory of all assests scanned within the 18F virtual Private
    Cloud. This includes all information system within the VPCs and compleoents within
    the Cloud.Gov platform as a service.

    SecOps and DevOps reviews and updates the information system component inventory
    on a monthly basis and updates the inventory of information system whenever installations,
    removals, and other changes are made. 18F will verify that all components within
    the authorized boundary of the information system are either inventoried as part
    of the system or recognized by another system as a component within that systems
    inventory.

    a: 'All Configuration Change control:

      18F provisions its infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CloudFormation
      template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings.
      Because these templates are text files, 18F can simply track differences in
      these templates to track changes to its infrastructure, similar to the way developers
      control revisions to source code.

      18F uses version control systems with its cloud formation templates to know
      exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when. If at any point 18F
      needs to reverse changes to infrastructure, you can use a previous version of
      a template.

      18F uses GitHub for additional tracking and documenting of authorized changes
      within the infrastructure and applications including Cloud Foundry platform
      as a service. Within  GitHub, a diff function is used to compare and contrast
      any changes made to configurations of Cloud Foundry.

      systems and infrastructure and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit

      of all configuration-controlled changes to the information system.  These audits
      take place no less than once a month and are documented in the GitHub ticketing
      and tracking system, per the 18F Configuration management policy Section 3 which
