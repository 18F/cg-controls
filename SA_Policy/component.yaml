      Agency System Maintenance Policy Implementation

      System Maintenance Policy is included in CIO P 2100.1 - GSA IT Security Policy, Chapter 4. Policy on Operational Controls. It states, "The availability and usability of GSA equipment and software must be maintained and safeguarded to enable agency objectives to be accomplished."

      GSA OCISO ISP also defined agency-wide system maintenance procedures in IT Security Procedural Guide: Maintenance (CIO-IT Security-10-50).

      18F follows the GSA System Maintenance policy for its information systems hosted within GSA facilities. The cloud.gov information system is hosted with the AWS GovCloud and will be in purview of the hosting siteâ€™s Maintenance policy and procedures.

      The 18F DevOps team practices the Scrumban process when developing new features or fixing existing issues, including security fixes and enhancements for cloud.gov.  Each feature or issue is assigned to a card in the system, where it goes through a process of being identified, prioritized, explored, delivered, and finally demonstrated. Each card is reviewed by the team as a whole throughout its lifecycle to identify any security risks or concerns, which are recorded on the card as "acceptance criteria" that must be addressed before development is complete.

      Once development is complete, a team member submits the code to our version control system as a "pull request", where at least one other team member further reviews it before merging it into the code base.  The team then deploys new features into our staging area where they undergo further security review and stakeholder acceptance testing, as well as automated acceptance tests.

      Each member of the 18F DevOps team has the necessary security background to properly handle sensitive data, such as security keys and certificates, and to evaluate the security implications associated with configuration changes. The cloud.gov team controls access to cloud.gov and its components through the access control tools appropriate for its components, including AWS security groups, Cloud Foundry roles, and GitHub team membership.

      18F applies security engineering principles primarily to new development of
      information systems. 18F uses the Cloud Foundry Secure Deployment best
      practices, which include the following: Configure UAA clients and users using a
      standard BOSH manifest for Cloud Foundry Development.  18F develops and maintains
      documentation on the baseline configuration of the information system that include
      network topology, system architecture, application, web, and server components
      along with software standards.  Cloud Foundry protects the information system
      from security threats by minimizing network surface area, applying security
      controls, isolating applications and data in containers, and encrypting
      connections.  It also implements role-based access controls, applying and
      enforcing permissions to isolate user to their space.  Baseline configurations
      settings are reviewed on a continual basis to to comply with federal mandates
      and compliance standards.  18F documents changes to the baseline configuration
      in GitHub for review.  Part of this process includes a thorough security analysis
      of the proposed change prior to the configuration change being implemented on
      the operational system.  18F deploys with every application a standard set of
      tools for security and monitoring of each application to identify security
      issues. For more details please refer to 18F Configuration Management Policy
      and security controls CM-2, CM-3, and CM-6.

      18F will replace information system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; and will provide justification and documented approval for the continued use of unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business needs.

      Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service system replacement:

      A system and software inventory is run nightly, and the DevOps team reviews the inventory weekly to ensure that all software inventoried is accurate and currently supported. This process includes:

      * Verify that the software license support expiration date is not within six months. 18F uses the open source version of Cloud Foundry which uses the open source Apache 2.0 license.
      * Ensure that the software version is still supported.
      * Refer to the vendor's support website to verify that support does not have an \u201CEnd of Life\u201D date of less than six months.

      Since 18F is using the open source version of Cloud Foundry, an additional task will be issued to upgrade the Cloud Foundry suite to the latest versions. DevOps will review the GitHub cloudfoundry/cf-release repository for implementation of the updated version.
