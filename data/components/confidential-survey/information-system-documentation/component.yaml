      narrative: |
        The database for the survey system consists of two tables. The `tallies` table records the tallies for any given _survey_id, question key, question choice_ triple. Surveys themselves are not stored in a database but are loaded from read-only configuration files that are deployed to the server. The `tokens` is used for storing single-use tokens that are generated by administrators and distributed to survey takers.
