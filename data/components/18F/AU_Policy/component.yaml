    b: 'Audit logs will be made available to organizations for mutual support in response
      to security breaches, system and user access, incident reporting and continuous
      monitoring.

      18F will generate and distribute audit reports, provide customized dashoard
      access for audited events, and send audit log data to SIEM and log analysis
      systems from its  audit logging and metrics tools for the Cloud.Gov platform
      and virtual infrastructure as needed.

      '
    c: '18F retains audit logs according to NARA retention standards to provide support
      for after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to meet regulatory
      and organizational information retention requirements.

      The log management framework will provide the capability to retain logs for
      90 days online and one-year offline, with sufficient capacity as to mitigate
      the risk of exceeding storage space.

      Specific Policies, Procedures, Points of Contact, and Guidance will be established
      between 18F and other agencies to support after-the-fact investigations, by
      the 18F Project Lead.

      DevOps and SecOps teams will conduct weekly manual and automated continuous

      * Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

      By default, Loggregator streams logs to a terminal. 18F will drain logs to a
      third-party log management service such as ELK and AWS CloudTrail
