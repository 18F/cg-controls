    External penetration testing activities are conducted by GSA OCISO on an annual

    against Cloud.Gov based on all necessary security requirements. The GSA OCISO
    follows the GSA CIO IT Security Procedural Guide, CIO-IT Security-11-51, Conducting
    Penetration Test Exercises when performing these tests.


    18F must request permission from AWS using the AWS Vulnerability / Penetration
    Testing Request Form to conduct penetration test activities against its own Virtual
    Private Cloud infrastructure and follow the AWS Acceptable Use Policy.

    Amazon requires customers to obtain authorization for penetration testing (or
    vulnerability assessments) both from or to their AWS resources.

    Internal Penetration testing


    For internal penetration testing inside 18F''s Virtual Private Cloud, 18F team
    members will conduct whitebox/greybox testing of the 18F environment using approved
    assessment tools.


    For compliance with NIST Publication 800-53 CA-8, Parameter 1 Penetration Testing
    of all 18F Infrastructure and Application Components will occur annually. Parameter
