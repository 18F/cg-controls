    ELK ( Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana) a front end component for loggregator is
    used to automatically audit all actions within the Cloud.Gov platform. By binding
    an instance of the service to, Cloud.Gov applications logs will be drained to
    a Logstash syslog receiver and stored in Elasticsearch to perform realtime data
    analytics with Kibana as the interface for search and visualization.
